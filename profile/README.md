# Source repositories for Genshin Novel Reader components

This is an introduction of Genshin Novel Reader project.

Each component of Genshin Novel Reader has its own source code repository on Github.

- Novel Reader (JavaScript Version): https://github.com/Novel-Reader/Genshin-novel-reader
- Novel server: https://github.com/Novel-Reader/Genshin-novel-reader-express-server
- Novel Reader (Typescript Version): https://github.com/Novel-Reader/novel-reader-ts
- Document source code: https://github.com/Novel-Reader/Genshin-novel-reader-doc
- Code after document compilation: https://github.com/Novel-Reader/Novel-Reader.github.io

Before version 1.0, both server code and reader code were maintained in one repository Genshin Novel Reader. After 1.0, the main code was divided into two parts: the front-end reader code Genshin Novel Reader and the back-end server code Genshin Novel Reader express server.
